# Sailfish OS Firefox default handler
Simple app to set Firefox as default browser on Sailfish OS

# Informations about installation

If you love Firefox as I do, this app is just for you. Please read the description carefully.

This app must (and will) run as root to do some things, which are:

* Enabling adb
* Moving default url handler to backup folder
* Moving new handler to right folder
* Creating new script that starts adb after restart
* Updating database

You can easily restore the default url handler from this app, but you MUST NOT remove this app before disabling the Firefox url handler. Believe me, don't remove the app before disabling.

If the app does not respond while enabling or disabling, don't quit it, just wait a few seconds.

Contains English and Czech localization.

And you need Firefox for Android installed on your device (surprisingly).
